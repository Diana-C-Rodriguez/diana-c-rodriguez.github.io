    "text": "Generative art by Anders Hoff. This is part of his project “Inconvergent”, which explores the complex behavior that emerges from systems with simple rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the chart above clearly demonstrates the different discount rate changes between hyperbolic and exponential discounting; however, the unites of the time delay variable could be more specifically labeled, as could the relevance of the rate over time. Additionally, the graph key is a bit misleading by using two different measures of change. The hyperbolic change seems to have a quicker descent at first; however, the key seems to contradict that in this visual."
