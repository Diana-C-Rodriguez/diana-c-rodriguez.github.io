This is part of his project “Inconvergent”, which explores the complex behavior that emerges from systems with simple rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the chart above clearly demonstrates the different discount rate changes between hyperbolic and exponential discounting; however, the unites of the time delay variable could be more specifically labeled, as could the relevance of the rate over time. Additionally, the graph key is a bit misleading by using two different measures of change. The hyperbolic change seems to have a quicker descent at first; however, the key seems to contradict that in this visual."

This\\r\\nmomentous decree came as a great beckoning light of hope to\\r\\nmillions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of\\r\\nwithering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long\\r\\nnight of their captivity.                                                                                                                                     \n [3] But one hundred years later the Negro is still not free. One\\r\\nhundred years later the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled\\r\\nby the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n [4] One hundred years later the Negro lives on a lonely island of\\r\\npoverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n [5] One hundred years later the Negro is still languishing in the\\r\\ncomers of American society and finds himself in exile in his own\\r\\nland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n [6] We all have come to this hallowed spot to remind America of\\r\\nthe fierce urgency of now. Now is the time to rise from the dark\\r\\nand desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial\\r\\njustice. Now is the time to change racial injustice to the solid\\r\\nrock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice ring out for\\r\\nall of God's children.                                                                                                                             \n [7] There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until\\r\\nthe Negro is granted citizenship rights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n [8] We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of\\r\\ndignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to\\r\\ndegenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise\\r\\nto the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul\\r\\nforce.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n [9] And the marvelous new militarism which has engulfed the Negro\\r\\ncommunity must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for\\r\\nmany of our white brothers have evidenced by their presence here\\r\\ntoday that they have come to realize that their destiny is part\\r\\nof our destiny.                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n[10] So even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow\\r\\nI still have a dream.
