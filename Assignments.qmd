![Although the chart above clearly demonstrates the different discount rate changes between hyperbolic and exponential discounting; however, the unites of the time delay variable could be more specifically labeled, as could the relevance of the rate over time. Additionally, the graph key is a bit misleading by using two different measures of change. The hyperbolic change seems to have a quicker descent at first; however, the key seems to contradict that in this visual.](images/chart.jpg)
