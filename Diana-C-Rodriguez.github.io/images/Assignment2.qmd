Run Paul Murrell's RGraphics basic R programs (murrell01.R in GitHub)

1)    plot(pressure, pch=16): Can you change pch?

Yes, the "pch" alters the shape of the data points on the graph

2)    points(x, y1, pch=16, cex=2): Try different cex value?

I tried a larger "cex" value and noticed that the size of the data points became larger

3)    axis(1, at=seq(0, 16, 4)): What is the first number standing for?

The following line correlates to the line in question: mtext("Travel Time (s)", side=1, line=2, cex=0.8).

4)    Exercise: Can you generate these charts individually? 

Yes. Each graph can be generated independently by isolating the desired graphs syntax.
