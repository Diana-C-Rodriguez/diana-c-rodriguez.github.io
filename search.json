This is part of his project “Inconvergent”, which explores the complex behavior that emerges from systems with simple rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the chart above clearly demonstrates the different discount rate changes between hyperbolic and exponential discounting; however, the unites of the time delay variable could be more specifically labeled, as could the relevance of the rate over time. Additionally, the graph key is a bit misleading by using two different measures of change. The hyperbolic change seems to have a quicker descent at first; however, the key seems to contradict that in this visual."

    "text": "About the data:\nThe data set used aimed to observe the net domestic immigration rates (NDIR), which represents the net movement of people into and out of a state, over the period 1990-1994 divided by the population of the state. Alaska and Hawaii are excluded from the analysis because the environments of these states are significantly different from the other 48, and their locations present certain barriers to immigration. Eleven predictor variables thought to influence NDIR are defined in Table 1.4.\n\nGenerated charts:\nThe first and second tax bracket shows a higher number of people immigrating in this tax bracket than emigrating. However, the third and fourth tax brackets have lower immigration rates than emigration rates. This shows there is no general trend of NDIR in relation to all four tax brackets.\nWhat can be observed is that the lower the value of NDIR, the more people are emigrating out of the state, the higher the value of NDIR, the more people are immigrating into the state.\nThe immigration/emigration graph organized by region, suggests that people in the Northeast region almost exclusively emigrate. The effects of region on tax bracket model shows that none of the participants responded that they belonged in either of the first two tax brackets. This could also be the reason that we do not see Northeast noticeably represented in the aggregated model.\nIndependent Variable (IV): Regional Tax Brackets\nDependent Variable (DV): NDIR (Net Domestic Immigration Rate)\npeople immigrating- “1”\nemigrating - “0”\n\n# Setting up the new R environment, starting fresh, click run!\n\nrm(list=ls())\n\n# Setting up the working directory, click run!\n\nsetwd(\"~/Desktop/PhD /UTD/FALL 22/EPPS 6356/Diana-C-Rodriguez.github.io\")\n\n# Reading the file, click run!\n\nHW4 <- read.delim(\"HW4data.txt\")\n\nhead(HW4)\n\n        State   NDIR Unemp  Wage Crime Income Metrop Poor Taxes Educ BusFail\n1     Alabama  17.47   6.0 10.75   780  27196   67.4 16.4  1553 66.9    0.20\n2     Arizona  49.60   6.4 11.17   715  31293   84.7 15.9  2122 78.7    0.51\n3    Arkansas  23.62   5.3  9.65   593  25565   44.7 15.3  1590 66.3    0.08\n4  California -37.21   8.6 12.44  1078  35331   96.7 17.9  2396 76.2    0.63\n5    Colorado  53.17   4.2 12.27   567  37833   81.8  9.0  2092 84.4    0.42\n6 Connecticut -38.41   5.6 13.53   456  41097   95.7 10.8  3334 79.2    0.33\n   Temp    Region\n1 62.77     South\n2 61.09      West\n3 59.57     South\n4 59.25      West\n5 43.43      West\n6 48.63 Northeast\n\n# Turning on the packages required for HW4, click run!\n\nlibrary(\"Hmisc\")\n\nLoading required package: lattice\n\n\nLoading required package: survival\n\n\nLoading required package: Formula\n\n\nLoading required package: ggplot2\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'Hmisc'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    format.pval, units\n\nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")\n\n── Attaching packages\n───────────────────────────────────────\ntidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n\n\n✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10\n✔ tidyr   1.2.1      ✔ stringr 1.4.1 \n✔ readr   2.1.2      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 \n✔ purrr   0.3.4      \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter()    masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()       masks stats::lag()\n✖ dplyr::src()       masks Hmisc::src()\n✖ dplyr::summarize() masks Hmisc::summarize()\n\n# Identifying the mean of HW4 for later usage: mean= 10.88854, click run!\n\nmean(HW4$NDIR)\n\n[1] 10.88854\n\n# Creating a new dummy variable, i.e. above 1 or below 0 mean, click run!\n\nHW4$NDIR_dummy <- ifelse(HW4$NDIR>=10.88854, 1, 0)\n\n# Creating taxes into an ordinal variable with 4 equally sized bins, click run!\n\nHW4$tax_ord <- cut2(HW4$Taxes, m=12)\n\n# Creating cross tabulation, click run!\n\ntable(HW4$NDIR_dummy,HW4$tax_ord)\n\n   \n    [1535,1853) [1853,2126) [2126,2371) [2371,3655]\n  0           5           4           7          10\n  1           7           8           5           2\n\n# Creating bar plot, click run!\n\nbarplot(table(HW4$NDIR_dummy,HW4$tax_ord), beside=TRUE, main= \"The Effect of Tax Brackets on NDIR\", xlab= \"Tax Brackets\", ylab= \"NDIR\", legend = TRUE)\n\n\n\nbarplot(table(HW4$NDIR_dummy,HW4$Region), beside=TRUE, main= \"The Effect of Region on NDIR\", xlab= \"Region\", ylab= \"NDIR\", legend = TRUE)\n\n\n\nbarplot(table(HW4$tax_ord,HW4$Region), beside=TRUE, main= \"The Effect of Region on Tax Brackets\", xlab= \"Region\", ylab= \"Tax Bracket Prevalence\", legend = TRUE)\n\n\n\n# Code for a Table with Embedded Charts\n\n# ggplot(df,aes(z,x,fill=as.factor(y)),angle=45,size=16)+ geom_bar(position=\"dodge\",stat=\"identity\") +facet_wrap(~z,nrow=3)\n\n# Creating Table with Embedded Charts, click run! \n\ndf <- data.frame(HW4)\n\np <- ggplot(df,aes(tax_ord,NDIR,fill=as.factor(Region)),angle=45,size=5)+ geom_bar(position=\"dodge\",stat=\"identity\") +facet_wrap(~tax_ord,nrow=3)\n\np + ggtitle(\"The Effect of Tax Brackets on NDIR by Region\") + xlab(\"Tax Brackets\") + ylab(\"NDIR\") + guides(fill=guide_legend(title=\"Region\")) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6))"

One\\r\\nhundred years later the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled\\r\\nby the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n [4] One hundred years later the Negro lives on a lonely island of\\r\\npoverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n [5] One hundred years later the Negro is still languishing in the\\r\\ncomers of American society and finds himself in exile in his own\\r\\nland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n [6] We all have come to this hallowed spot to remind America of\\r\\nthe fierce urgency of now. Now is the time to rise from the dark\\r\\nand desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial\\r\\njustice. Now is the time to change racial injustice to the solid\\r\\nrock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice ring out for\\r\\nall of God's children.                                                                                                                             \n [7] There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until\\r\\nthe Negro is granted citizenship rights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n [8] We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of\\r\\ndignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to\\r\\ndegenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise\\r\\nto the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul\\r\\nforce.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n [9] And the marvelous new militarism which has engulfed the Negro\\r\\ncommunity must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for\\r\\nmany of our white brothers have evidenced by their presence here\\r\\ntoday that they have come to realize that their destiny is part\\r\\nof our destiny.                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n[10] So even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow\\r\\nI still have a dream.
